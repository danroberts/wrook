OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

- Implement aggressive caching with a "entity instance touched" cache invalidation pattern
  Investigate the OnChange handler from Aaron Raddon (http://aaronspotlatch.appspot.com/entry/blog-app-engine-caching-data)
- Optimize code with memcache
- Optimize the model
- Test the memoize decorator from "http://hackmap.blogspot.com/2008/10/appengine-memcache-memoize-decorator.html"


CODE OPTIMIZATION

From wrook.py:
	Merging of URLMappings # USE THE REGISTER PATTERN AND CACHE THE COMPOUNDED RESULTS

	In the template: (everything by language)
	- Cache the signed-in header
	- Cache the anonymous header
	- Cache the visited member header
	- Cache the theme CSS
	- Review how themes are loaded

MODEL OPTIMIZATION
- Use entity groups for hierarchical data structuress
- Stop using .count(), user sharded counters if needed
- Put Topic and Reply in entity groups
