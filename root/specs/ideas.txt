Most online writers also maintain a blog,
	and they use this blog to promote their writing,
	thus offering the possibility of integrating their blog with
	wrook would give then the opportunity to build on their existing efforts.
	Wrook could bring them traffic and vice versa.
	
	- RSS Feed for a profile or a book.
	- Scriptlets for their blogs.
	- Blog using wrook? Or push a preview of their blog to wrook.
	- Ability to push their blog posts to their wrook profile/books.
	- Ability to read a book outside of wrook directly on their site,
		behaving similar to an embeded reader.

Active authors post their books to multiple online services and try to
	provide cross-linking between each relevant services,
	thus Wrook should enable them to add any number of links on the
	welcome page of their books. Popular services could have a more formal
	type of link and shown with a reconizable icons. Those formal links could
	then be presented as options when possible. (ex.: Buy online from:...)

Member use many different online services, many of which are complementary to
	wrook, thus it could be usefull for them (readers and authors) to be able
	to provide a list of where else they have a profile.
